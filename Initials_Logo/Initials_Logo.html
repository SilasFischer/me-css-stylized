    <h1> Initials as Logo </h1>
    <p> My initals are S, E, F. So for this assignment I created a logo that would merge each of the individuals letters into a single path. The S composes the general shape of the logo, the E is formed by adding a bar at the top of the S with a curve justting out of the line that connects the bottom and top curve, and the F is made by mimicing the curve of the E on the other side of the line. To further diferentiate the diffent letters, I chose to include an inner stroke gradient that flows through with distint color zones. </p>
