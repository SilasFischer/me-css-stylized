    <h1> When We Sleep, We Dream. </h1>
    <h2> But, his waking body is never able to remember these dreams, so his waking body purposed a plan to record his sleeping body. Perhaps he is capable of capturing these dreams. </h2>
    <p> He sets up a camera to snap a picture every five or ten or fifteen minutes while he sleeps. Maybe, somehow, the dreams will seep out of his mind and into the lens of the camera. The next morning, he looks through the hundred or so photographs in an attempt to find some glimpse, some remanence, of some dream. </p>
